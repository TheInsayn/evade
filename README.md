# evade
This is a simple C#/WPF game created as a university project.    
It stems from an ancient hobby project which I've written in school times, that has been improved and totally reworked from ground up.    
You can find the original WinForms code in `evade_forms.zip`.

### About the game
The game is simple.    
You are a (yellow) rectangle and are trying to avoid (red) falling blocks.    
The longer you survive the better your score.    
A local file named `highscore.hs` is keeping track of the best score.
